# k-means-clustering
A Python implementation of K-Means clustering to analyze sales data and group similar transactions based on sales patterns



# 📊 K-Means Clustering on Sales Data  

This project applies K-Means clustering to sales data, identifying patterns in customer orders. The dataset contains sales transactions, and we segment them into clusters based on key numerical attributes.  

# 🚀 Features  
✔ Data Preprocessing – Handles missing values and normalizes features  
✔ K-Means Clustering – Groups data into clusters for insights  
✔ Visualization – Generates a scatter plot of clustered data  
✔ Output File – Saves clustered data as `clustered_sales_data.csv`  

# 📁 Dataset  
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data 

# 🛠 Requirements  
Before running the script, install the necessary dependencies:  

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
📜 How to Run
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/k-means-clustering-sales.git
cd k-means-clustering-sales
Place the dataset file (sales_data_sample.csv) in the same directory.
Run the Python script:
bash
Copy
Edit
python k_means.py
The clustered sales data will be saved as:
Copy
Edit
clustered_sales_data.csv
The output scatter plot will be displayed automatically.
📊 Output Visualization
The following image represents clustered sales data:


Clusters are color-coded, helping identify customer order trends.

📌 Customization
Modify the number of clusters (n_clusters) in the script:
python
Copy
Edit
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0)  # Change 3 to any other number
You can add more features to improve clustering results.
📜 Code Overview
This script performs the following:

Loads the dataset (sales_data_sample.csv)
Handles missing values (replaces with mean values)
Normalizes numerical features (StandardScaler)
Applies K-Means clustering (3 clusters by default)
Assigns cluster labels to the original dataset
Visualizes clusters with Matplotlib
Saves the clustered data as a CSV file
